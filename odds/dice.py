"""
Exact probability distributions for the reroll / bonus / keep-top-K dice rule.

Rule for each of the ``n`` original dice (each a die with ``faces`` = F faces):

1. Roll the die once.
2. If the rolled face belongs to the reroll set, reroll it exactly once; the
   new face is the die's final face. Otherwise the first face is final.
3. If (and only if) the final face is the maximum face F, roll one extra
   bonus dF and add it to that face. The bonus die is never rerolled and
   never triggers another bonus die.

So one original die contributes a value between 1 and 2F.  Value F itself is
impossible: a final face of F always comes with a bonus of 1..F, giving
F+1..2F.

From the n per-die values the largest K are summed.

Every probability here is an exact :class:`fractions.Fraction`.  The returned
distribution always sums to exactly 1 — no Monte Carlo noise.
